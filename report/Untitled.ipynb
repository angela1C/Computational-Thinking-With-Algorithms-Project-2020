    "# 1. Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section I will introduce the concept of sorting algorithms and discuss the relevance of concepts such as time and space complexity, performance, in-place sorting, stable sorting, comparator functions, comparison-based and non-comparison-based sorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the information here is based on Algorithms in a Nutshell by George T. Heineman, Gary Pollice and Stanley Selkow and lecture notes for the Computational Thinking with Algorithms at GMIT.\n",

    "[Sorting](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sorting) is the process or operation of ordering items and data according to specific criteria. Arranging items, whether manually or digitally into some order makes many common tasks easier to do. Sorted information is nearly always easier for human beings to understand and work with, whether it is looking up a number in a phone book, finding a book on a library or bookshop shelf, referring to a statistical tables book, deciding what to watch on television. It is even more applicable with technology. Social media and news feeds, emails, search items in a browser or recommendations for where to eat to what to do are all sorted according to some algorithms whether it is by date, popularity, location etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous computations and tasks can be simplified and made more efficient by having the data sorted in advance, such as searching for an item, checking for duplicate items, determining the smallest and largest values, or the most common or least common values. Sorting is a common operation in many computer applications and the search for efficient sorting algorithms dominated the early days of computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Algorithms to live by The Computer Science of Human Decisions](Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths)[2], sorting is at the very heart of what computers do and is what actually brought computers into being in the first place. The task of tabulating the US Census in the late nineteenth century became very difficult as the population grew. An inventor by the name of Herman Hollerith was inspired by the punched railway tickets of the time to devise a system of punched cards and a machine (the Hollerith Machine) to count and sort them. This system was then used for the 1890 census. Hollerith's company later merged with others in 1911 to become the Computing Tabulating Recording Company which was later renamed to International Business Machines (IBM). \n",
    "Sorting then lay behind the development of the computer in the 20th century. By the 1960's it was estimated by one study that more than a quarter of the world's computing resouces were spent on sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a set of rules to obtain the expected output from the given input. A computer programming task can be broken down into two main steps - writing the algorithm as an ordered sequence of steps that can be used to solve the problem and then implementing the sequenced of steps in a programming language such as Python so that the machine can run the algorithm. While humans can usually follow algorithms that are not very precise in order to accomplish a task, this is not the case for computers and therefore the algorithms have to be written very precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways that algorithms could be designed to achieve a similar goal. Therefore there needs to be some way of deciding which algorithm is preferable for a particular use case and therefore some way of comparing the alternative algorithms is required. A well-designed algorithm should produce the correct solution for a given input using computational resources efficiently. It should have well defined inputs and outputs and the algorithm should end after a finite number of steps. Every step of the algorithm should be precisely defined so there is no ambiguity as a computer can only do what it is instructed to do.\n",
    "The algorithm should always produce a correct solution, or at least one that is within an acceptable margin of error. The algorithm should be feasible giving the computational resources such as processing power, memory, storage etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms vary in their space and time efficiency, even those that have the same purpose such as sorting algorithms. \n",
    "While space efficiency looks at the amount of memory or storage needed to run a program/algorithm, time efficiency looks at the effect of the input data on the run time or number of operations needed to run an algorithm.\n",
    "An algorithms efficiency can be analysed in two different ways. A priori analysis (before) looks at the efficiency of an algorithm from a theoretical perspective without being concerned with the actual implementation on any particular machine.\n",
    "The relative efficiency of algorithms is analysed by comparing their *order of growth* with respect to the size of the input N and is a measure of the **complexity** of an algorithm, looking at the growth requirements as the input size increases. (The order of growth refers to how the size of the resource requirements increase as a function of the input size n.  As input size increases so too does the number of operations required and the work required).\n",
    "Complexity measures an algorithm’s efficiency with respect to internal factors, such as the time needed to run an algorithm and is a feature of the steps in the algorithms rather than the actual implementation of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "A posteriori analysis, on the other hand, is a measure of the **performance** of an algorithm and evaluates efficiency empirically, comparing algorithms implemented on the same target platform to get their relative efficiency.\n",
    "Performance depends on the actual computer resources such as time, memory, disk, speed, compiler etc required to run a specific algorithm. Performance does not affect complexity but complexity can affect performace as the algorithm's design will feed into how the code is written and implemented. (This project involves measuring the actual performance of sorting algorithms and therefore depends on the specifics of the machine used.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of an algorithm to complete is one of the most important factors for choosing an algorithm. The speed will highly depend on the platform it is run on and therefore cannot really compare algorithms that are run on different machines with different capabilities or come to conclusions about the algorithm in general. While you could use a limited form of empirical comparison on your own machine, the results could not be applied generally. Instead the concept of complexity can be analysed mathematically. The actual time an algorithm takes to run doesn't tell the full story as it can be influenced by other factors such as the the available memory or the speed of the processor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity allows for algorithms to be compared by looking at their running time as a function of the input data size and in this way see which algorithms scale well to solve problems of a nontrivial size. Algorithmic complexity typically falls into one of a number of growth families (i.e. the growth in its execution time with respect to increasing input size n is of a certain order). Complexity looks at how the resource requirements grow as the input size increases, how the time required increases as the number of inputs increase.\n",
    "Memory or storage requirements of an algorithm could also be evaluated in this manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are other factors (including memory usage, storage usage, network usage, number of read-write operations) to be considered when evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm, the main focus in this project is the time efficiency - how the time taken varies with the size of the input. The algorithm should complete its task in an acceptable amount of time\n",
    "\n",
    "The runtime of sorting algorithms can be measured by measuring the actual implementation of the algorithm using a timer function like pythons `timeit` module. The theoretical runtime complexity can be measured uses Big $O$ notation which is a measure of the expected efficiency of an algorithm and measures the asymptotic behaviours of functions which means it measures how quickly a function grows or declines. The growth rate of a function is also called its *order*.  \n",
    "Big $O$ represents the relationship between the size of the input $n$ and the number of operations the algorithm takes and shows how quickly the the runtime grows as the input size increases. It is usually used to describe the complexity of an algorithm in the worst-case scenario. It could also be used to describe the execution time required or the memory space used by an algorithm. \n",
    "While for small input size n all algorithms are efficient, when the size becomes non-trivial then the order or growth of an algorithm will become more and more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two algorithms have the same Big $O$ notation, that does not mean they will execute in exactly the same times, but that the order of the number of operations that they will require to complete will be the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "The details of the project will look at the runtime complexity of 5 different sorting algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), *in computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure. However a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes. In-place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The various sorting algorithms differ from each other in their memory requirements which depends on how the actual algorithm works. When a sorting algorithm is run, it has to first read the input data from a storage location to the computers RAM. An **in-place** sorting algorithm is one that only uses a fixed additional amount of working space, no matter what the input size whereas other sorting algorithms may require additional working memory  which is often related to the input size. If there is limited memory available then in-place sorting is desirable.\n",
    "By producing the sorted output in the same memory space as the input data to be sorted avoids the need to use double the space. A sorting algorithm will still need some extra storage for working variables though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithm create empty arrays to hold sorted copies and this requires more memory as the size of the input increases. (mention which ones). In-place sorting does not require additional arrays as the relative position of the elements are swapped within the array to be sorted and therefore additional memory should not be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is considered **comparison-based** if the only way to gain information about the total order is by comparing a pair of elements at a time using comparator operators to see which of the two elements should appear first in the sorted list. Comparison sorts do not make any assumptions about the data and compare all the elements against each other.\n",
    "Simple sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort are comparison-based sorts.  On the other hand, there are other sorting algorithms such as Counting Sort, Bucket Sort and Radix Sort which do make some assumptions about the data. These type type of algorithms consider the distribution of the data and the range of values that the data falls into and in doing so avoiding  the need to compare all elements to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers and single characters can be quite easily sorted. While composite elements such as strings of characters are usually sorted by sorting each individual element of the string. Two elements can be compared to each other to see if they are less than, greater than or equal to each other.  Sorting of custom objects may require a custom ordering scheme. In general a comparator function compares the elements $p$ to $q$ and returns 0 if $p$ = $q$, a negative number if $p$ < $q$, and a positive number if $p > q$. Using the example provided in the book, an airport terminal might list outbound flights in ascending order of destination city or departure time while flight numbers appear to be unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Algorithms in a Nutshell, if a collection of comparable elements\n",
    "$A$ is presented to be sorted in place where $A[i]$ and $ai$ refer to the ith element in the collection with $A[0]$ being the first element in the collection, then to sort the collection the elements $A$ must be reorganised so that if $A[i] < A[j]$, then $i < j$. Any duplicate elements must be contiguous in the resulting ordered collection. This means that if $A[i] = A[j]$ in a sorted collection, then there can be no $k$ such that $i < k < j$ and $A[i] ≠ A[k]$. Finally, the sorted collection A must be a permutation of the elements that originally formed $A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The book also outlines how \"the elements in the collection being compared must admit a total ordering. That is, for any two elements p and q in a collection, exactly one of the following three predicates is true: `p = q`, `p < q`, or `p > q` \".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stability** means that equivalent elements will retain their relative positioning after the sorting has taken place.\n",
    "With a stable sorting algorithm the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output.\n",
    " It is an important factor to consider when sorting key value pairs where the data might contain duplicate keys. This project only looks at sorting one dimensional arrays of integers but there are many other applications of sorting where the data has more than one dimension, in which case the data is sorted based on one column of data known as the key with the rest of the data is known as satellite data and should travel with the key when it is moved to another position.\n",
    "According to [Reference: Pollice G., Selkow S. and Heineman G. (2016). Algorithms in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition. O' Reilly.], if two elements (ai and aj) in the original unsorted data are equal (as determined by the comparator function), stable sorting refers to the fact such pairs of equal elements will retain their relative ordering after the sorting has taken place. If i < j then the final location of a<sub>i</sub> must be to the left of a<sub>j</sub>. Sorting algorithms that can guarantee this property are considered stable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is considered stable if two objects with equal keys end up in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the input. An unstable algorithm does not pay attention to the relationship between element locations in the original collection and does not guarantee the relative ordered will be kept after the sorting has taken place.\n",
