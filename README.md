# Computational Thinking with Algorithms project 


This repository contains a collection of files for the Benchmarking Sorting Algorithms project submitted as part of the requirement for the Computational Thinking with Algorithms module at GMIT as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing and Data Analytics programme. The actual project was to be submitted through the college Moodle platform as a zip file. This repository serves as a reference for the project.

The aim of the Computational Thinking with Algorithms module was to provide a comprehensive grounding in solving computational problems and designing algorithms. 

### Project Specification

- Write a Python application which will be used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms. 
- Write a report which introduces the algorithms you have chosen and discusses the results of the benchmarking process.

The five sorting algorithms which you will implement, benchmark and discuss in this project must be chosen according to the following criteria:
1. A simple comparison-based sort (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort or Insertion Sort)
2. An efficient comparison-based sort (Merge Sort, Quicksort or Heap Sort)
3. A non-comparison sort (Counting Sort, Bucket Sort or Radix Sort)
4. Any other sorting algorithm of your choice
5. Any other sorting algorithm of your choice


The Python application should include implementations of the five sorting algorithms, along with a main method which tests each of them.


This repository contains:
- A `scripts` subfolder with the main `benchmarking.py`  program and five sorting algorithms written in Python.
- An `output` subfolder containing CSV files files produced by the Python scripts.
- An `images` subfolder containing plots produced by the Python scripts. 
- A `report` subfolder containing the final report in PDF together with supporting images and diagrams.


The Python code was developed using the  Visual Studio Code editor.
The final report was initially written using Markdown in Visual Studio code and then converted to PDF format.
